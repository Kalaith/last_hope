## 🚀 Strategic Upgrade Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Core Gameplay Transformation (Immediate Priority)**

#### 🎯 **Daily Survival Loop**
**Goal**: Transform from story-reader to survival-manager

**Implementation**:
```
Daily Planning Phase:
├── Resource Allocation (4-6 action points per day)
├── NPC Assignment (who does what today?)
├── Risk Management (weather, threats, opportunities)
└── Strategic Decisions (short vs long-term goals)

Execution Phase:
├── Watch consequences unfold
├── Respond to random events
├── Make crisis decisions
└── See day's results

Reflection Phase:
├── Review progress toward goals
├── Plan next day's strategy
└── Adapt to new challenges
```

**Key Features**:
- **Action Point System**: Limited actions per day force meaningful choices
- **Time Pressure**: Events happen whether you're ready or not
- **Resource Scarcity**: Never enough resources to do everything you want
- **Meaningful Consequences**: Today's decisions affect tomorrow's options

#### ⚖️ **Risk/Reward Balance System**
**Goal**: Every choice should have potential gains AND losses

**Examples**:
- **Exploration**: Find valuable resources BUT risk injury/exposure
- **Research**: Gain powerful tech BUT use limited knowledge points
- **Construction**: Improve settlement BUT deplete supplies and workforce
- **NPC Relations**: Build trust BUT require time/resource investment

#### 🎲 **Dynamic Events & Challenges**
**Goal**: Create unpredictable situations requiring adaptation

**Event Categories**:
- **Environmental**: Storms, droughts, toxic rain, solar flares
- **Resource**: Equipment failure, contamination, discovery
- **Social**: NPC conflicts, newcomer arrivals, leadership challenges
- **Exploration**: New areas unlock, dangerous encounters, ruins discovered

### **Phase 2: Strategic Depth Expansion**

#### 🏗️ **Advanced Base Building**
**Current State**: Basic structures with maintenance
**Upgrade To**: Complex interconnected systems

**New Features**:
- **Resource Chains**: Solar Panel → Battery → Workshop → Advanced Tools
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Layout affects productivity and happiness
- **Specialization Paths**: Focus on Research, Agriculture, Industry, or Defense
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Different biomes require different approaches

#### 👥 **Deep NPC Management**
**Current State**: Simple trust/relationship tracking
**Upgrade To**: Complex character simulation

**New Features**:
- **Individual Skills**: Each NPC has specialties and limitations
- **Personality Conflicts**: Some NPCs work poorly together
- **Growth Systems**: NPCs can learn new skills over time
- **Leadership Challenges**: Managing competing priorities and opinions
- **Succession Planning**: What happens if key NPCs are lost?

#### 🌍 **Meaningful Exploration**
**Current State**: Static zones with simple rewards
**Upgrade To**: Procedural exploration with strategic decisions

**New Features**:
- **Risk Assessment**: Scout areas to evaluate danger vs. reward
- **Expedition Planning**: Prepare teams with right skills and equipment
- **Discovery Chains**: Finding clues leads to bigger discoveries
- **Territory Control**: Establish outposts to secure resource areas

### **Phase 3: Content & Replayability**

#### 🎲 **Procedural Systems**
- **Random Events**: Weather patterns, resource discoveries, NPC encounters
- **Procedural World**: Different layout and challenges each playthrough
- **Variable Start Conditions**: Different crisis scenarios and starting resources
- **Seasonal Cycles**: Long-term patterns that require adaptation

#### 🏆 **Meta-Progression & Achievements**
- **Knowledge Persistence**: Some research carries over between runs
- **Character Backgrounds**: Unlock new starting options through play
- **Challenge Modes**: Harder difficulties with unique rewards
- **Achievement System**: Meaningful goals that guide exploration

#### 📈 **Difficulty Scaling**
- **Adaptive Challenge**: Game responds to player skill level
- **Multiple Victory Paths**: Science, Agriculture, Diplomacy, Exploration
- **Long-term Goals**: 100+ day campaigns with meaningful milestones
- **New Game Plus**: Start new settlement with some accumulated advantages

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Plan

### **Priority 1: Core Game Loop (Weeks 1-2)**

#### Daily Action System
```typescript
interface DailyPlan {
  actionPoints: number;          // 4-6 per day
  assignments: NPCAssignment[];  // Who does what
  resourceAllocations: ResourcePlan;
  riskTolerance: 'conservative' | 'balanced' | 'aggressive';
}

interface ActionPoint {
  type: 'explore' | 'build' | 'research' | 'social' | 'maintain';
  target: string;
  npcRequired?: NPCSpecialty;
  resourceCost: ResourceCost;
  riskLevel: number;

interface GameEvent {
  id: string;
  trigger: EventTrigger;
  severity: 'minor' | 'major' | 'crisis';
  timeToResolve: number;
  availableResponses: EventResponse[];
  consequences: EventConsequence[];
}

interface EventResponse {
